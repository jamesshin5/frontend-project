Submission Notes

Given more time, what would you have done differently?
I really did the bare minimum as I am especially busy this weekend, but I should've made the header a component since its being used the same way in both pages. I also wanted to play around with more modern looking styles.

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
I strayed a little bit from the given design for personal aesthetic reasons.

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
Employed responsive design through Chakra ui, so website should be responsive at different breakpoints.

I didn't really know how to arrange the project, so pls cd into reddit-clone-james and yarn start.
